The purpose of these project is to illustrate fundamental behavior of muon decay and to measure the average duration of the life of a muon i.e. the muon decay. 
The results obtained verified the relationship between the discriminator settings to that of the efficiency of the instrument filtering unwanted noise. The higher the
discriminator settings led to better results.

The data analysis plots and measurements are all shown in the muon.py file. A manuscript that details the project can be read which is titled muon_manuscript.pdf.
