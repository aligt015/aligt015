- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ali,
- I am currently pursuing my second bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics at the University of Georgia. Previously, I attended Georgia Institute of Technology and completed a 
- bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics. I am pursuing my second bachelorâ€™s in physics because I have a love of astronomy with a strong desire in obtaining a career
- that focuses on the physical sciences, quantitative methods, data analysis, coding abilities and more. I created this repo mostly for myself in order to organize all my
- projects.
