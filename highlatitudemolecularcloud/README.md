This project consists of identifying large scale trends for the high latitude molecular clouds. The detections were surveyed in the CO (1-0) transition at
115 GHz. Identifying large scale trends is interesting since there might be systematic motions that might tell us where these clouds came from, for example, if the detected points all move in the same velocity and line widths, this may imply that the clouds formed in the same event. 

To represent the line widths, a blue line was used in every detected point, where the wider the line width corresponds to wider blue lines which is shown in the image trends.png. To represent the velocities, an angle was used where Î¸ = arcsin(LSR/15). This angle is represented by the same blue line used for the line width but as you can see in the trends.png image some of the detected points are rotated at an angle.

The files in this project are:

1. gridpoints.txt file is all the positions that were observed. They number about 15,000 with roughly 10,000 in the Northern Galactic Hemisphere and 5,000 in the South. The first column is corresponds to the galactic longtitude while the second column is the galactic latitude.
2. detections.txt corresponds to the detected molecular gas.
3. velocity.txt is the line width the correspond to the detected molecular gas.
4. vlsr.txt is the LSR velocity that is used to form the angle needed in order to visualize large scale trends of the detected molecular gas.
