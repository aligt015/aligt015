This project consisted of a photocatalytic degradation experiment with methylene blue, where a semiconductor (CuO and TiO2) and UV light were used to analyze the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst. Pollution caused by dyes contents, like methylene blue, causes major challenges to the enviornment so the goal of this experiment was to study the degradation efficiency of CuO and TiO2.

The experiment consisted of:

- 250 W quartz halogen lamp.
- The incident light intensity on the sample is kept constant at 65 mW/cm2 and measured by an optical power meter.
- Concentration level of methylene blue was at 31.3 uM.
